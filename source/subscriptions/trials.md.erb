## Offer free trials to your customers

Offering trials for your service is a great way to make your customers able
to test your service before buying it. ProcessOut makes it easy to provide
trial periods when using subscriptions.

#### How trial periods work

A trial period on a subscription is defined by a date at which the trial period
will end. This field is the attribute `trial_end_at` of a subscription, and can
be `null` if you don't want to allow any trial period for a given subscription.

Behind the hood, ProcessOut's workers will pull any transaction with a trial date
that is set in the past and set this field to `null`. Any subscription with a
subscription's attribute `trial_end_at` containing a date is therefore 
considered as being in trial. Customers do not get charged when a subscription
is still in its trial period.

Additionnaly, when a subscription trial period gets to an end, the `iterate_at` 
attribute of the subscription gets set to the current time to effectively start
the next iteration immediately.

#### Apply a trial to a subscription

Trials can be applied at any given time in a subscription life-cycle. However,
if applied when the subscription is active, the current subscription period will
be overwritten, meaning that the `iterate_at` date set on the subscription will
be ignored and reset when the trial gets to an end.
