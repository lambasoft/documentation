## Upgrades, downgrades and prorating

Upgrading and downgrading subscriptions often involves complicated logics and
maths to correctly prorate the cutomer's subscription amount. ProcessOut can do
it all for you

#### Understanding what prorating does

When a customer upgrades or downgrades its [`Subscription` &nearr;](/refs/#subscriptions) in the middle of it,
it means that part of the subscription was used, and the other part wasn't.
In other terms, it means the customer has paid for something that's not 
going to be used anymore. For this reason, merchants might want to charge
the customer an additional amount of money for an upgrade, or give the customer
credit for a downgrade.

Let's see a quick example: The customer John has subscribed to a box service. 
This subscription costs him $10 per month. However, John wants to upgrade his
subscription to get a better box each month and switches to the $20 plan at
the day 15 (of 30) of the subscription.

This means that of the `$10` that John paid for the initial plan, he used half
of it (`15 / 30`), which represents `$5`. Because John switches over to a plan
that costs `$20` per month, the second half of the subscription will cost him
`$10` (`$20 / 2`). John is therefore in debt for `$10 - $5 = $5`, which he'll
be automatically charged for by ProcessOut when he switches over to the new plan.

The same applies for a downgrade. However, because the customer doesn't have any
debt anymore but is rather owed money by the merchant, ProcessOut will add this 
amount to the customer balance so that John gets charged less for his next payment.

Prorating is therefore used to preserve the subscription period but keep the
amount owed by the customer or merchant up to date.

#### Upgrading or downgrading a customer

To upgrade or downgrade a [`Customer` &nearr;](/refs/#customers), all you'll need to do is to update the 
subscription with the new plan ID.

Prorating may also be enabled or disabled when it best fits the merchant needs.
It is disabled by default.
