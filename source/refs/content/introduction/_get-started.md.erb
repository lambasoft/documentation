## Get started

### Libraries

```javascript
npm install processout
```

```python
pip install processout
```

```php
composer require processout/processout-php
```

```go
go get gopkg.in/processout.v2

// The godoc can be found at https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/processout.v2
```

Installing and setting up the libraries/modules/packages in your project is most
of the time really easy, and only consists of running a couple of commands and/or
dropping in some files.

Please refer to the code on the right to install the library in your preferred
language.

You may also want to simply run a `git clone` command or download an archive containg
the library, and manage the dependencies yourself.

You can find all our repositories on the [ProcessOut Github](https://github.com/processout).

### Setting up

```javascript
// Load package
var ProcessOut = require('processout');

// Instantiate ProcessOut
var client = new ProcessOut.ProcessOut(
    "proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4",
    "key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd");
```

```python
# Load dependencies
from processout.processout import ProcessOut

# Instantiate ProcessOut
client = ProcessOut("proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4", "key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd")
```

```php
<?php
// Load dependencies
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Instantiate ProcessOut
$client = new \ProcessOut\ProcessOut(
    "proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4",
    "key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd");
```

```go
// Package import
import "gopkg.in/processout.v2"

// Instantiate ProcessOut (in a method)
client := processout.New(
    "proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4", 
    "key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd")
```

To use ProcessOut's API, you will need to authenticate yourself using your API keys.
Your API keys are composed of your `project-id` and `project-secret`. To get
these keys, you will need to have created a new project on your dashboard.

Once the authentication is done, a `ProcessOut` object should be returned,
representing your ProcessOut project.
