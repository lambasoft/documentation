When a resource's state changes, ProcessOut will create an `Event` object which can
be programmatically fetched. This can be used to notify your application
when a transaction gets completed, or when a subscription iterates to its next
period, but can also have many other possible applications.

You can find all the events we currently fire [here](#events-data).

It is also important to note that events are extremely powerful when they're
coupled with [webhooks](#webhooks). As soon as an event is created, we'll send
a request to your web application to notify you of this new event so it can
fetched and processed.

**You may find on the right pane an example of what the content of the `data` field
might look like.** The data is basically composed of the object the event describes
at the top level, and this object has its first level resources expanded (when
available). If you wish to access deeper resources, you will need to fetch those
from the API.

##### Attributes
|||
--:|:--
**id**<br />*string*<br />Read-only |
**name**<br />*string*<br />Read-only | Name of the event corresponding to the action
**data**<br />*json object*<br />Read-only | Data linked to the event
**fired_at**<br />*timestamp*<br />Read-only |
**sandbox**<br />*boolean*<br />Read-only |


### Fetch an event

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
ProcessOut.Event.find("ev_T3wg9169RyGLnf1BIgTjLhrolEZU1DSb").then(
    function(event) {
        // We may now access the event

    }, function(err) {
        // An error occured

    });
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
event = processout.Event.find("ev_T3wg9169RyGLnf1BIgTjLhrolEZU1DSb")
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$event = ProcessOut\Event::find("ev_T3wg9169RyGLnf1BIgTjLhrolEZU1DSb");
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
ev, err := client.Events.Find("ev_T3wg9169RyGLnf1BIgTjLhrolEZU1DSb")
```

Fetch an event by its ID. An error is thrown when the event could not be found.


### Invoice events

The invoice events are created when an update regarding an [invoice](#invoices)
occurs.

##### Events
|||
--:|:--
invoice.waiting | No payment has been placed yet
invoice.pending | The payment is pending confirmation by the payment gateway
invoice.completed | The payment was sucessfully completed
invoice.failed | The payment has been placed, but failed
invoice.disputed | The payment was previously completed but the customer filled a dispute
invoice.solved | The previous dispute has been resolved in your favor
invoice.reversed | The previous dispute has been resolved in your customer's favor
invoice.refunded | You refunded the transaction

### Subscription events

The subscription/recurring invoice events are created when an update regarding
a [subscription](#subscriptions) occurs.

*Note:* When a recurring-invoice/subscription iterates, a new [invoice](#invoices)
and its associated [transaction](#transactions) will be created and  marked as
completed, and its corresponding event will also be sent.

##### Events
|||
--:|:--
subscription.started | The subscription started
subscription.iterated | The customer paid for the current iteration of its subscription
subscription.trial_ended | The subscription trial ended
subscription.payment_failed | The payment of the current subscription period failed
subscription.canceled | The customer's subscription was canceled <br />*Note:* It might have been canceled because the payment gateway refused your customer's payment (ex: when the credit card expired). The reason of the cancellation is available in the `cancellation_reason` attribute of the subscription
