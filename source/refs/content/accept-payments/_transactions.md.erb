## Transactions

Transactions are *read-only* objects linked to their corresponding [invoice](#invoices),
representing the actual payment that occured on an invoice.

ProcessOut will automatically generate and/or update Transaction resources
depending on the status of the payment.

Any metadata specified on an invoice will also be available in the metadata of
its transaction for easy reference.

As seen in the transaction's attributes, it also contains a `status`, representing
the current status of the transaction. This status is automatically updated
by ProcessOut when an update occurs on the transaction.

You may find the full list of transaction statuses [here &nearr;](/payments/handle-status-changes-webhooks.html).

### Fetch a transaction

```sh
curl https://api.processout.com/transactions/tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC \
    -u proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4:key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
ProcessOut.Transaction.find("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC").then(
    function(transaction) {
        // Transaction was fetched
    }, function(err) {
        // An error occured
    });
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
transaction = processout.Transaction.find("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC")
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$transaction = \ProcessOut\transaction::find("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC");
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
tr, err := client.Transactions.Find("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC")
```

It is possible to fetch a transaction by its ID. An error is thrown if the 
transaction could not be found.
